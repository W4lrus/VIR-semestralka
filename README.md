## HOW TO: Switch main display rendering off
Open setting.json file from Documents/Airsim and add the following option to it.
  ```json 
  "ViewMode": "NoDisplay"
  ```
Than you can start AirSim simulation and the screen should be black.
See [settings](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/docs/settings/#viewmode) for more info.
